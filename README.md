# e-commerce-back-end

This program keeps a database of an ecommerce store's inventory. There are tables for products, categories, tags, and product tags in a database called ecommerce_db. The program can be ran in a terminal using the node server.js command. There are routes for getting all items in any given table, getting a single item, creating items, deleting items, and updating items. Testing for this program was done in Insomnia.
